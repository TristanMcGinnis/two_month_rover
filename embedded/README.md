# Pico Code

## Instructions
1. Choose to use PlatformIO w/ VSCode or ArduinoIDE
   If using ArduinoIDE, open as normal
   If Using PlatformIO, you'll need to modify the file extension to .cpp (probably rename to main.cpp) and include the <Arduino.h> library
2. Simply upload this code to the pico
3. This code should remain in your final program so the relay can automatically locate the pico
   Implement more commands or restructure the program to your preference (recommended)
