# Rover Two Month 2023 Demo Software Stack

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the individual README files in each folder to launch each. 
3. Let me know on Discord (@iamanti_) if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer. I'll keep a compilation of questions answered in this document.

## Notes
1. I've included the source file as a .ino so you can just use Arduino IDE for programming your pico
2. If you 'd like to use PlatformIO (with VS Code)
     If you run into any problems with coding in PlatformIO, try making sure there are no spaces in your folder path.
     All you should need to do to get the .ino functioning in Platform is change it to .cpp and include the <Arduino.h> library
